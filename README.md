# Some-basic-CPP-Projects  
In this Git Repo, I have added some very basic CPP Projects
1. [ASCII value to Character](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/ASCIItoCharacter.cpp "ASCII value to Character"): In this project, we have written a code where you can take user input that can only be an integer and in the output the character associated to that ASCII value will be displayed. For exmaple, if you input 65, it will output 'A'.
2. [Character to ASCII value](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/CharactertoASCII.cpp "Character to ASCII value"): In this project, we have written a code where you can take user input that can only be a character and in the output the ASCII value associated to that character value will be displayed. For example, if you input 'Z', it will output 90.
