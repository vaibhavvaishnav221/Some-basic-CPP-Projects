# Some basic CPP Projects  
In this Git Repo, I have added some very basic CPP Projects
1. [ASCII value to Character](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/ASCIItoCharacter.cpp "ASCII value to Character"):- In this project, we have written a code where you can take user input that can only be an integer and in the output the character associated to that ASCII value will be displayed. For exmaple, if you input 65, it will output 'A'.

2. [Character to ASCII value](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/CharactertoASCII.cpp "Character to ASCII value"):- In this project, we have written a code where you can take user input that can only be a character and in the output the ASCII value associated to that character value will be displayed. For example, if you input 'Z', it will output 90.

3. [Table of any number upto 10](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/Tableofanynumberupto10.cpp "Table of any number upto 10"):- In this project, we have written a code where you can take input from a user that can only be a number and after taking input we have used the for loop function in which the number taken as user input will be multiplied from 1 upto 10 and will be displayed as output on the console.

4. [Area of Circle](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/areaofcircle.cpp "Area of Circle"):- In this project, we have written a program where we can take user input as whole number as well as a decimal number and then the program will calculate the radius of the circle.

5. [Calculate the Hypotenuse of a right triangle](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/calc_hypotenuse_of_right_triangle.cpp "Calculate the Hypotenuse of a right triangle"):- In this project, we have written a program where you can take user input the base and the perpendicular of the triangle and on their basis it will execute the program and will return the output(Hypotenuse).

6. [Grade Calculator](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/gradecalculator.cpp "Grade Calculator"):- In this project, we have written a program where you can input your grades that can be of integer data type and on the basis of the marks, it will calculate your Grade and will output it on the console, nested if function has been used for this program.

7. [If Else](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/ifelse.cpp "If Else"):- In this program, we have used an if else function to check whether the input number has a character of uppercase or else. Like if you insert values form 65 to 90, it will output the character as well as whether the character is Uppercase Alphabet or not.

8. [Loops](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/loops.cpp "Loops"):- In this program, we first take a number of whose multiples you want and then take another number upto whose multiples you want using a for loop.
![Loops](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/Screenshot%20(86).png "Loops")
9. [Operators](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/operators.cpp "Operators"):- In this program, we can take two numbers of int data types and then it performs all the 4 types of operations(+, -, *, /) on the two input operands and outputs them on the console.

10. [Percentage Calculator](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/percentage.cpp "Percentage Calculator"):- In this program, we have written the code where you can input all your marks obtained in all the subjects and it will calculate your percentage and will display it on the console.

11. [Simple Interest Calculator](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/simpleinterest.cpp "Simple Interest"):- This program calculates the simple interest where you have to input all the necessary details like principal amount, interest rate and time(in years).

12. [Square](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/square.cpp "Square"):- This program calculates the square of any number and displays it on the console.

13. [Temperature Converter](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/tempconverter.cpp "Temperature Converter"):- This program converts Kelvin temperature in Celsius and Celsius temperature into Kelvin using the if else function.

14. [Printing Hello World!'s code in C++](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/printing_helloworld's_code_in_Cpp.cpp "Printing Hello World!'s code in C++"):- This is a program written in C++ which prints the entire source code needed to print "Hello World!" on the console in C++

15. [Calculating the Area and Volume of Cylinder](https://github.com/vaibhavvaishnav221/Some-basic-CPP-Projects/blob/main/calculating_area_and_volume_of_cylinder.cpp "Calculating the Area and Volume of Cylinder):- In this Program, we have written a code where you can input the radius and height of any clinder and it will print the Total Surface area and the volume of the cylinder.
